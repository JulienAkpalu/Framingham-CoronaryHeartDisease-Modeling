# Framingham Heart Study - CHD Risk Prediction

## Introduction
This project delves into the Framingham Heart Study dataset to develop a predictive model for the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The focus is on using R for comprehensive data analysis, exploring key risk factors, and modeling to predict CHD risk.

## Objectives
- Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing for effective modeling.
- Apply statistical methods for feature selection and analysis.
- Develop a predictive model to estimate the 10-year risk of CHD.

## Dataset Description
The Framingham dataset comprises several key variables for CHD risk assessment:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, etc.
- **Health Metrics**: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status.
- **Lifestyle Data**: Smoking status, physical activity.
- **Target Variable**: 10-year CHD risk.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and guide for the project.
- `data/`: Contains the Framingham dataset.
- `scripts/`: R scripts for the project.
  - `data_preparation.R`: For data cleaning and preparation.
  - `exploratory_analysis.R`: For performing EDA.
  - `model_building.R`: For creating the predictive model.
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional materials.
- `results/`: Output files, such as figures and model output.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R Programming**
- **Key Libraries**: Include libraries like tidyverse, caret, randomForest, etc.
